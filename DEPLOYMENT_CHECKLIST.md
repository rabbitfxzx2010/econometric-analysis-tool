# ✅ Deployment Checklist: From Testing to Live

## 🔄 **Complete Deployment Workflow**

### **Phase 1: Development & Testing**

#### **1.1 Switch to Development Branch**
```bash
git checkout development
```

#### **1.2 Make Your Changes**
- Edit `econometric_app.py`
- Update `requirements.txt` if adding new packages
- Update documentation if needed

#### **1.3 Local Testing**
```bash
# Test your app locally
streamlit run econometric_app.py

# Check these things:
# ✅ App starts without errors
# ✅ File upload works
# ✅ All estimation methods work
# ✅ Visualizations display correctly
# ✅ No error messages in console
```

#### **1.4 Commit Development Changes**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added [describe your new feature]"
git push origin development
```

### **Phase 2: Deployment to Live App**

#### **2.1 Switch to Main Branch**
```bash
git checkout main
```

#### **2.2 Merge Tested Changes**
```bash
git merge development
```

#### **2.3 Final Check (Optional but Recommended)**
```bash
# Quick local test on main branch
streamlit run econometric_app.py
```

#### **2.4 Deploy to Streamlit Cloud**
```bash
git push origin main
```

### **Phase 3: Verify Deployment**

#### **3.1 Monitor Streamlit Cloud**
- Go to your Streamlit Cloud dashboard
- Watch the build logs
- Wait for "App is running" status (usually 2-3 minutes)

#### **3.2 Test Live App**
- Visit your app URL: `https://your-app-name.streamlit.app`
- Test basic functionality
- Verify new features work

#### **3.3 Share with Students (If All Good)**
- Update course materials with app URL
- Send announcement to students
- Provide any new usage instructions

## 🚨 **Emergency Rollback Process**

If something breaks after deployment:

### **Quick Fix Method:**
```bash
# 1. Revert to previous working commit
git log --oneline -5  # Find previous working commit hash

# 2. Reset to that commit
git reset --hard [commit-hash]

# 3. Force push to fix live app immediately
git push --force origin main

# 4. Fix the issue in development branch later
git checkout development
# Fix the problem
# Test again
# Re-deploy when ready
```

### **Safer Rollback Method:**
```bash
# 1. Create a revert commit (keeps history)
git revert [problematic-commit-hash]

# 2. Push the revert
git push origin main
```

## 📊 **Deployment Status Monitoring**

### **Streamlit Cloud Dashboard:**
1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Click on your app name
3. Monitor status:
   - 🟢 **Running**: App is live and working
   - 🟡 **Building**: Deployment in progress
   - 🔴 **Error**: Something went wrong

### **Build Logs:**
- Click "Manage app" → "Logs"
- Look for error messages if deployment fails
- Common issues:
  - Missing packages in `requirements.txt`
  - Python syntax errors
  - Import errors

---

## 🔧 **Common Deployment Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: Missing Packages**
**Problem**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'xyz'`
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Add missing package to requirements.txt
echo "package-name==version" >> requirements.txt
git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "Added missing package"
git push origin main
```

### **Issue 2: Syntax Errors**
**Problem**: App won't start due to Python errors
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Test locally first
python -m py_compile econometric_app.py
# Fix any syntax errors
# Test with streamlit run econometric_app.py
# Then deploy
```

### **Issue 3: Large Files**
**Problem**: Deployment fails due to file size
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Remove large files, use .gitignore
echo "*.large_file_extension" >> .gitignore
git rm --cached large_file.ext
git commit -m "Removed large files"
git push origin main
```

---

## 📈 **Post-Deployment Best Practices**

### **1. Version Tagging**
```bash
# Tag major releases
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Initial release"
git tag -a v1.1 -m "Added export feature"
git push origin --tags
```

### **2. Keep Development Branch Updated**
```bash
git checkout development
git merge main  # Sync with deployed version
```

### **3. Regular Backups**
- Your GitHub repo IS your backup
- Consider downloading periodic exports
- Document major changes in README.md

### **4. Monitor Usage**
- Check Streamlit Cloud dashboard occasionally
- Monitor for any error reports from students
- Keep an eye on resource usage
